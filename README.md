## Developement
### Design Patterns
* **Strategy** - An AI's moves are chosen through an algorithm. Different AI difficulties have different algorithms for the way it chooses a move
* **Model-View-Presenter** - To separate the components' representation from its logic and relations and facilitate unit testing
* **Memento** - Implement 'Undo last play' functionality (only on local gameplay)

### Relevant Design Decisions
 - Choosing MVP over MVC as the main architectural design pattern turned out to be very useful, given the 'button-based' interface for both in-game and menu controls
 - Having the game logic implemented seperately from the rest of the application allowed to easily write tests to check its functionalities
 - The early on research and structural design regading viewports, layouts and other libGDX related visual elemements allowed us to properly make a responsive app that works across multiple devices
 - The well-design separation of concerns regarding the main components made the AI integration alongside the user controls seamless
  - The same applied to the online multiplayer integration, however the Play Games API integration was a lot of work
 - Having each visual board position handle its logic allowed us to gradually implement additional visual functionalities, such as animations and placement suggestions, while leaving the game logic intact.
